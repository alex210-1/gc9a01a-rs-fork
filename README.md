# Rust GC9A01A driver

Rust library for working with the GC9A01A display driver.  
This crate supports `no_std` and can be used with
[`embedded-graphics`](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics).

This repository is still a work-in-progress, but the basic functionality
is already in-place.

## Examples
